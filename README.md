From the oficial web of Transfer Markt we aimed to first scrap some of the best players in the market for seasons from 2009 to 2024, then build a df and preprocess it.
We construct a dashboard to visually analyse the dataset with all the metrics associated to a player, a league and football clubs.
We then applied several models to conduct the prediction of a player's value in the market for next season.
